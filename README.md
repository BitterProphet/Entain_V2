1. Add another filter to the existing RPC, so we can call `ListRaces` asking for races that are visible only.
   > We'd like to continue to be able to fetch all races regardless of their visibility, so try naming your filter as logically as possible. https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/standard_methods#list
      testing: 
      1. curl -X "POST" "http://localhost:8000/v1/list-races" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d $'{"filter": {"visible": true}}'
      2. curl -X "POST" "http://localhost:8000/v1/list-races" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d $'{"filter": {"visible": false}}'

2. We'd like to see the races returned, ordered by their `advertised_start_time`
   > Bonus points if you allow the consumer to specify an ORDER/SORT-BY they might be after. 
3. Our races require a new `status` field that is derived based on their `advertised_start_time`'s. The status is simply, `OPEN` or `CLOSED`. All races that have an `advertised_start_time` in the past should reflect `CLOSED`. 
   > There's a number of ways this could be implemented. Just have a go!
4. Introduce a new RPC, that allows us to fetch a single race by its ID.

5. Create a `sports` service that for sake of simplicity, implements a similar API to racing. This sports API can be called `ListEvents`. We'll leave it up to you to determine what you might think a sports event is made up off, but it should at minimum have an `id`, a `name` and an `advertised_start_time`.
> Note: this should be a separate service, not bolted onto the existing racing service. At an extremely high-level, the diagram below attempts to provide a visual representation showing the separation of services needed and flow of requests.
